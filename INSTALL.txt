The bitweaver game plugin lets you create a concentration based card game. In its current incarnation, the game expects that the cards players match will be about energy (you have to submit a kwh value for each card) but it is an easy foundation for any card matching game.

To install the game, you'll want to start with Bitweaver:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitweaver

Lazy? Try:
  cvs -z3 -d:pserver:anonymous@bitweaver.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/bitweaver co -P example bitweaver

Where "example" is the directory you're installing to. If all you want is a card game, you can delete a lot of Bitweaver components that you don't need for the game:

  rm -R articles/ blogs/ boards/ calendar/ events/ fisheye/ gatekeeper/ geo/ gmap/ ilike/ messages/ newsletters/ nexus/ pdf/ pigeonholes/ quicktags/ quota/ recommends/ rss/ shoutbox/ smileys/ stars/ stencils/ stickies/ tags/ treasury/ wiki/

And, you'll need to download a few addons that aren't part of the basic install. If you already went the CVS route, you're looking for:

  cvs co -d games _bit_games
  cvs co -d energymeasures _bit_energymeasures
  cvs co -d suggestions _bit_suggestion
  cvs co -d yamlconfig _bit_yamlconfig
  cvs co -d badbehavior _bit_badbehavior
  cvs co -d lcconfig _bit_lcconfig

You need bitweaver's temp and storage directories to be recursively web-server writeable. But you don't want them publicly accessible at all. Assuming your web server runs as apache, try:

  chown -R apache:apache temp storage
  chmod -R 750 temp storage

You'll also want to change the permissions of the files in "temp":
find temp -type f -exec chmod 640 {} \;

Create a world-writeable config file for your initial install process (don't forget to come back and change this later): 
  
  touch kernel/config_inc.php
  chmod 777 kernel/config_inc.php

Create a database for your game files. 

Now you can navigate, browser style, to your installation and walk through the install gui.
